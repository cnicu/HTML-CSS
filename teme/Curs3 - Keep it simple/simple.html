        Wait a minute, I said i wanted simple, but not boring. What is up with this design? There's nothing on it but white space and some text and minimal picture. That's not what i had in mind. The typ is all in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't excite me at all. There is just no character to anything here. It has a minimal look, but it's just too vanilla. I really need something to grab the attention of a visitor to the site and this just doesn't do it.</p>
